## Steps to setup the project

Installation Steps:
1.	Install Python:
<br>&nbsp•	If Python is not already installed on your system, download and install Python from the official website: Python Downloads.
<br>&nbsp•	Follow the installation instructions provided on the website for your operating system.
<br>2.	Clone the Project Repository:
<br>&nbsp•	Clone the project repository containing the dashboard code to your local machine. You can do this using Git or by downloading the repository as a ZIP file and extracting it.
<br>3.	Navigate to the Project Directory:
<br>&nbsp•	Open a command-line interface (e.g., Command Prompt, Terminal).
<br>&nbsp•	Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you cloned or extracted the project repository.
<br>4.	Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):
<br>&nbsp•	It's a good practice to work within a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies. This step is optional but recommended.
<br>&nbsp•	Create a virtual environment by running the following command:
<br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     python -m venv myenv 
<br>&nbsp•	Activate the virtual environment:
<br>&nbsp•	On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
<br>&nbsp•	On macOS/Linux: source myenv/bin/activate
<br>5.	Install Required Python Libraries:
<br>&nbsp•	Once inside the project directory, install the required Python libraries specified in the requirements.txt file using pip:
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsppip install -r requirements.txt 
<br>&nbsp•	This command will install the necessary libraries such as Streamlit, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and numpy.
<br>6.	Run the Streamlit Application:
<br>&nbsp•	After installing the dependencies, you can run the Streamlit application by executing the following command in the command-line interface:
<br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     streamlit run app.py 
<br>&nbsp•	This command will start the Streamlit server locally, and you will see output indicating that the server is running.
<br>&nbsp•	Open a web browser and navigate to the URL provided in the output (usually http://localhost:8501) to access the dashboard interface.
