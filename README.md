## Steps to setup the project

Installation Steps:
1.	Install Python:
<br><p>  •	If Python is not already installed on your system, download and install Python from the official website: Python Downloads. </p>
<br><p>  •	Follow the installation instructions provided on the website for your operating system. </p>
<br>2.	Clone the Project Repository:
<br><p>  •	Clone the project repository containing the dashboard code to your local machine. You can do this using Git or by downloading the repository as a ZIP file and extracting it.</p>
<br>3.	Navigate to the Project Directory:
<br><p>  •	Open a command-line interface (e.g., Command Prompt, Terminal).</p>
<br><p>•	Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you cloned or extracted the project repository.</p>
<br>4.	Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):
<br><p>  •	It's a good practice to work within a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies. This step is optional but recommended.</p>
<br><p>  •	Create a virtual environment by running the following command:</p>
<br> <p>     python -m venv myenv </p>
<br><p>  •	Activate the virtual environment:</p>
<br><p>  •	On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate </p>
<br><p>  •	On macOS/Linux: source myenv/bin/activate</p>
<br>5.	Install Required Python Libraries:
<br><p>  •	Once inside the project directory, install the required Python libraries specified in the requirements.txt file using pip: </p>
<br><p>  pip install -r requirements.txt </p>
<br><p>  •	This command will install the necessary libraries such as Streamlit, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and numpy.</p>
<br>6.	Run the Streamlit Application:
<br><p>  •	After installing the dependencies, you can run the Streamlit application by executing the following command in the command-line interface:</p>
<br> <p>     streamlit run app.py </p>
<br><p>  •	This command will start the Streamlit server locally, and you will see output indicating that the server is running.</p>
<br><p>  •	Open a web browser and navigate to the URL provided in the output (usually http://localhost:8501) to access the dashboard interface.</p>
