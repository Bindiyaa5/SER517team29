## Steps to setup the project

Installation Steps:
1.	Install Python:
•	If Python is not already installed on your system, download and install Python from the official website: Python Downloads.
•	Follow the installation instructions provided on the website for your operating system.
2.	Clone the Project Repository:
•	Clone the project repository containing the dashboard code to your local machine. You can do this using Git or by downloading the repository as a ZIP file and extracting it.
3.	Navigate to the Project Directory:
•	Open a command-line interface (e.g., Command Prompt, Terminal).
•	Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you cloned or extracted the project repository.
4.	Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):
•	It's a good practice to work within a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies. This step is optional but recommended.
•	Create a virtual environment by running the following command:
python -m venv myenv 
•	Activate the virtual environment:
•	On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
•	On macOS/Linux: source myenv/bin/activate
5.	Install Required Python Libraries:
•	Once inside the project directory, install the required Python libraries specified in the requirements.txt file using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt 
•	This command will install the necessary libraries such as Streamlit, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and numpy.
6.	Run the Streamlit Application:
•	After installing the dependencies, you can run the Streamlit application by executing the following command in the command-line interface:
streamlit run app.py 
•	This command will start the Streamlit server locally, and you will see output indicating that the server is running.
•	Open a web browser and navigate to the URL provided in the output (usually http://localhost:8501) to access the dashboard interface.
